  <h1>Guidelines on Election Manifestos</h1><br>
The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 5th July 2013 in SLP(C) No. 21455 of 2008 ( S. Subramaniam Balaji Vs Govt. of Tamil Nadu and Others)<br>
 has directed the Election Commission to frame guidelines with regard to the contents of election manifestos in consultation with all <br>
the recognized political parties. The guiding principles which will lead to framing of such guidelines are quoted below from the judgment:-<br><br>

(i) “Although, the law is obvious that the promises in the election manifesto cannot be construed as ‘corrupt practice’ under Section 123 of RP Act, <br>
the reality cannot be ruled out that distribution of freebies of any kind, undoubtedly, influences all people. It shakes the root of free and fair elections to a large degree”.<br><br>

(ii) “The Election Commission, in order to ensure level playing field between the contesting parties and candidates in elections and also in order to see<br>
 that the purity of the election process does not get vitiated, as in past been issuing instructions under the Model Code of Conduct.<br>
 The fountainhead of the powers under which the Commission issues these orders is Article 324 of the Constitution which mandates the Commission to hold<br>
 free and fair elections.”<br><br>

(iii) “We are mindful of the fact that generally political parties release their election manifesto before the announcement of election date, in that scenario,<br>
 strictly speaking, the Election Commission will not have the authority to regulate any act which is done before the announcement of the date.<br>
 Nevertheless, an exception can be made in this regard as the purpose of election manifesto is directly associated with the election process”.<br>
Upon receiving the above directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Election Commission held a meeting with the recognized National and State Political Parties<br>
 for consultation with them in the matter and took note of their conflicting views in the matter.<br>

During consultations, while some political parties supported the issuance of such guidelines, others were of the view that it is their right and duty towards voters<br>
 to make such offers and promises in manifestos in a healthy democratic polity. While the Commission agrees in principle with the point of view that framing of<br>
 manifestos is the right of the political parties, it cannot overlook the undesirable impact of some of the promises and offers on the conduct of free and fair elections<br>
 and maintaining level playing field for all political parties and candidates.
<br><hr><br>The Constitution under Article 324 mandates the Election Commission, to conduct elections<br>
 inter alia to the Parliament and the State Legislatures. Having due regard to the above directions of the Supreme Court and after consultation with the Political Parties,<br>
 the Commission, in the interest of free and fair elections , hereby directs that Political Parties and Candidates while releasing election manifestos<br>
 for any election to the Parliament or State Legislatures, shall adhere to the following guidelines :-<br><br>

(i) The election manifesto shall not contain anything repugnant to the ideals and principles enshrined in the Constitution and further that it shall be consistent<br>
 with the letter and spirit of other provisions of Model Code of Conduct.<br><br>

(ii) The Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution enjoin upon the State to frame various welfare measures for the citizens and therefore there<br>
 can be no objection to the promise of such welfare measures in election manifestos. However, political parties should avoid making those promises which are likely to <br>
vitiate the purity of the election process or exert undue influence on the voters in exercising their franchise.<br><br>

(iii) In the interest of transparency, level playing field and credibility of promises, it is expected that manifestos also reflect the rationale for the promises<br>
 and broadly indicate the ways and means to meet the financial requirements for it. Trust of voters should be sought only on those promises which are possible to be fulfilled.<br>

(i) In case of single phase election, manifesto shall not be released during the prohibitory period, as prescribed under Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.<br><br>

(ii) In case of multi-phase elections, manifesto shall not be released during the prohibitory periods, as prescribed under Section 126 of <br>
the Representation of the People Act, 1951, of all the phases of those elections.”<br><hr><br><hr>
